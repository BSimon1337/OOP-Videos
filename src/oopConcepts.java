		 *Four pillars of OOP:
		 *1. Abstraction - only the essential details are displayed
		 *	- Triangle
		 *	- Table 
		 *2. Encapsulation - binds together code and the data manipulates it
		 *	- Driving a car - you don't need to know what the car does to move. The user doesn't need to know. Private functionality
		 *3. Inheritance
		 *	- Allows objects or classes to inherit from parent classes
		 *4. Polymorphis - something can take different forms
		 *	- Animals communicate in different ways
		 *	- The "method" communicate can take different forms
		 *
		 *Class - is how we structure our code in OOP
		 *Class is like a blueprint
		 *Object is the actual product developed from the blueprint
		 *An object is and Instance of a Class
